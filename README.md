## Single responsability
The Single Responsibility Principle states that a component should have
one, and only one, reason to change. This means that a component should only have one job. If it has more
than one job, it should be broken up into multiple components.
This is a very important principle to follow. It makes your components easier to understand, easier to test, and easier to maintain.

#### For example: 
We have a component that displays a list of users. It
also has a button that allows the user to add a new user. This component has two jobs. It displays a list of users, and it allows
the user to add a new user. This component should be broken up into two
components. One component should be responsible for displaying the list
of users, and another component should be responsible for allowing the
user to add a new user.
